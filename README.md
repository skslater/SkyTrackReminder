# SkyTrack Reminder
##  An X-Plane plugin that gives a reminder to start VA flight tracking

This plugin was originally designed for [Fly UK](https://flyuk.aero) but is tracker software agnostic and will work for any VA.

### Installation Instructions

* Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/skslater/SkyTrackReminder/releases) or compile it yourself from source.
* Extract the Zip file into your X-Plane plugins directory

### Usage

After turning on the main battery the plugin will display a reminder message in the centre of the screen to start your flight tracker.

The reminder will disappear as soon as any of the engines are started or can be manually dismissed under the plugin menu.
